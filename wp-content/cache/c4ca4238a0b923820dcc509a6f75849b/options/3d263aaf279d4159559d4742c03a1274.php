This is the first release since the plugin was added to the directory last week. It includes two new block types, along with other new features, improvements, and fixes for many bugs that previously severely impaired the editor&#8217;s usability.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/1391" target="_blank">Custom HTML</a> block allows users to add HTML and click to see a fast preview within the editor.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/487" target="_blank">Cover Image</a> block lets users place an image in the content with the background image fixed by default. Users can also specify text to have overlaid. Gutenberg developers emphasized that this feature should not be confused with the &#8220;Featured Image&#8221; panel which is already working in a similar way to how it has in the past.</p>

<p>While testing the Cover Image block with Twenty Seventeen and Twenty Fifteen, I was unable to get it working correctly on the frontend. Within the editor it works beautifully but once I launched the preview I found that, regardless of which positioning option I chose, I could not get the full image to display. The size of the image&#8217;s output was only as tall as the overlay text. If there was a right way to position it, I was unable to discover it. I checked with the development team and Matías Ventura said they are not loading styles for blocks in the front-end yet. Blocks like Cover Image that need CSS to display properly will not look right at the moment, but the plan is to focus on adding CSS for these this coming week.</p>
<p>A few of the notable fixes and improvements include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added button to delete a block</li>
<li>Added button to open block settings in the inspector</li>
<li>Rename “Freeform” block to “Classic Text”</li>
<li>Added support for pages and custom post types</li>
<li>Added ability to select all blocks with ctrl/command+A</li>
<li>Automatically generate wrapper class for styling blocks</li>
<li>Avoid triggering multi-select on right click</li>
<li>Avoid being keyboard trapped on editor content</li>

<p>Matt Mullenweg, the overall product lead for core releases in 2017, has published <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/16/4-9-and-gutenberg/" target="_blank">an overview for what users can expect in WordPress versions 4.9 and 5.0</a>. After the success of 4.8 and the initial release of Gutenberg last week, Mullenweg is aiming to see the plugin installed on 100K+ sites during the next few months before merging it into core. He also suggested that WordPress could put a promo for the plugin in the upcoming 4.8.1 release.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime I think we can do another user-focused 4.9 release with the theme of editing code and managing plugins and themes, doing v2s and polishing some features we brought into WP last year,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Weston and Mel already have some good ideas there, and we can start to discuss and brainstorm at the Dev chat next week. This will also allow the Gutenberg-driven release to be 5.0, which is a nice-to-have but not the primary driver of this decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullenweg elaborated on changes to the release process in <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/06/4-8-and-whats-coming/" target="_blank">a post on his personal blog</a>. The original idea was for releases to be driven by improvements to the three focus areas (the editor, customizer, and REST API), but the radical changes that Gutenberg introduces to the editing experience means that customization improvements will need to wait until the editor is a little further along:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Mel and Weston took this as an opportunity to think about not just the “Customizer”, which is a screen and code base within WP, but really thinking in a user-centric way about what it means to customize a site and they identified a number of low-hanging fruits, areas like widgets where we could have a big user impact with relatively little effort.</p>
<p>WordPress is littered with little inconsistencies and gaps in the user experience that aren’t hard to fix, but are hard to notice the 500th time you’re looking at a screen.</p>
<p>I didn’t think we’d be able to sustain the effort on the editor and still do a meaningful user release in the meantime, but we did, and I think we can do it again.</p></blockquote>
<p>During this week&#8217;s core development meeting, contributors brainstormed more specific items for inclusion in 4.9. The ability to schedule customizer changesets is one feature they discussed as a possibility. Customizer component co-maintainer Weston Ruter described the feature as &#8220;adding statuses for changesets: being able to draft a changeset to come back to later, and then to be able to schedule it to go live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-snapshots/" target="_blank">Customize Snapshots</a> feature plugin contains the UI for this and Customize Changesets, the term for the underlying infrastructure required for saving a Customizer session as a draft, <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-to-ship-with-infrastructure-from-the-customize-snapshots-feature-plugin" target="_blank">was added in WordPress 4.7</a>. Adding the UI in WordPress 4.9 would allow users to share Customizer sessions, preview them outside of the iframe, and schedule them to publish at a future date.</p>
<p>Andrew Roberts, a contributor to TinyMCE, said they should have a new mobile-optimized UX, which would result in a responsive toolbar, that could land within the proposed 4.9 timeframe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would wonder if we couldn&#8217;t tweak the UI to be closer to Gutenberg (e.g. white toolbars),&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;I had raised this idea before and it was thought it was better to wait until Gutenberg, but I remain of the opinion we could iterate a little bit closer to get users used to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contributors also discussed the possibility of changing the default font in the editor to ease the transition to Gutenberg in the future. Currently, Gutenberg uses system fonts for UI and Noto Serif for the editor text.</p>
<p>Mel Choyce, who is heading the Customizer focus with Weston Ruter, said she hopes the team can finish the Gallery Widget for 4.9. Current progress on the widget can be found on <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-core-media-widgets/pull/120" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.8.1 is tentatively planned for the last week in July, and contributors anticipate including a fix for some issues with the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40951" target="_blank">new Text Widget stripping out code</a>.</p>

<p>One of the featured sessions at WordCamp Europe 2017 was Om Malik&#8217;s interview with Matt Mullenweg, followed by a 20-minute Q&amp;A from the audience. After showing a preview of the new Gutenberg editor with dynamic blocks replacing widgets, Mullenweg announced that it is now <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank">available as a plugin on WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>Gutenberg has been in development for six months and is ready for testing, but its developers do not recommend using it on production sites. Anyone interested in the future of WordPress will want to take it for a test drive, as the new editor will revolutionize the way users think about creating and editing content. The demo video at WordCamp Europe also showed Gutenberg working smoothly in a mobile context.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may appear that WordPress is trying to copy its more recent competitors (Medium, Wix, and others) to keep pace, but the 14-year-old software has offered many of these content capabilities for years. Mullenweg explained how the new editor simply unifies the UI into blocks that can be placed anywhere. Gutenberg is set to replace widgets, the HTML UI of shortcodes, and blocks previously offered through the TinyMCE toolbar.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-blocks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken stabs at this before, if you imagine our previous efforts with post formats &#8211; to make it easier to do certain types of media or quote posts or things like that,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That whole concept can now flatten to just being a block. Working all that in, it&#8217;s bringing things we&#8217;ve been thinking about for a very long time in WordPress.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever sat down with a new user to introduce them to WordPress, then you probably answered a long list of painful questions regarding the many varied and confusing ways of creating content. Gutenberg has the potential to make WordPress much easier to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now WordPress makes you learn a lot of concepts &#8211; shortcodes, widgets, the stuff that exists inside TinyMCE as blocks today &#8211; and people rightly wonder why they can&#8217;t use those things everywhere,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is shift it so that you only have to learn about blocks once and once you learn about the image block, that can be in a post, in a sidebar, in a page, in a custom post type, and it will work exactly the same way. Whatever is integrated with it, let&#8217;s say a plugin that brings in your Google Photos or your Dropbox, that will now work everywhere, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullenweg said his previous attempt at replacing TinyMCE lasted approximately two years and they never ended up shipping it. Getting Gutenberg off the ground at this time allows WordPress to take the best of what competitors in both open source and commercial spaces have been doing, and improve upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medium started five or six years ago,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Browser technology, what you can do, has advanced quite a bit. I think this actually allows us to leapfrog past some of the really great visual editors, because we&#8217;re able to build on the shoulders of things like Medium, Wix, Squarespace, and others that have come before us.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Gutenberg First Impressions and Concerns</h3>
<p>The Gutenberg plugin is now active on more than 300 sites and first impressions are rolling in. This is the first time the new block editor has been easily accessible to any user who wants to try it. Gutenberg also offers a somewhat unique testing experience in that it creates its own menu inside WordPress, so users don&#8217;t have to choose between the old editor and the new one. Activating Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t make it an either/or experience and users can test at their own convenience.</p>
<p>From my initial testing, I found that Gutenberg provides a clean and enjoyable experience. Up until this point many of us couldn&#8217;t fully anticipate what Gutenberg would look like, but the interface is very similar to what one might imagine for an improved &#8220;distraction-free writing experience.&#8221; Gutenberg provides a more minimal UI for both the visual and text editors, although inserting blocks seems to be less functional when using the text editor.</p>
<p>There are still many bugs and rough edges, but this interface appears to be a natural evolution of WordPress&#8217; content editing experience. It <em>feels</em> like WordPress. The editor pulls in many of the elements that have worked well historically and introduces a minimal UI that makes it possible for anyone to build a beautiful, feature-rich post without knowing any HTML. Gutenberg is the most exciting thing to happen to WordPress in a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The default state is likely my favorite &#8216;Distraction Free Writing&#8217; implementation in WordPress yet,&#8221; WordPress core committer Aaron Jorbin said in <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/" target="_blank">a post listing his initial observations</a>.  I’m simultaneously able to focus on my content, and yet I have all the tools I need for writing. I don’t have all the tools I need for content creation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matt Cromwell, co-author of GiveWP, also wrote up his <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/" target="_blank">first impressions of Gutenberg</a> with high compliments for the new writing experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years we’ve seen Medium become the de facto elegant writing experience,&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Medium is able to do that though by limiting the formatting and layout options dramatically. Gutenberg has the potential to allow writing to be as elegant as Medium or more so, plus deliver far more flexibility with layouts and content types.&#8221;</p>
<p>One area of uncertainty for WordPress developers is how Gutenberg will handle support for plugins and maintain a high level of performance with a large number of custom blocks added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I miss a lot of the meta boxes I’m used to seeing on the screen,&#8221; Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;Things like Yoast SEO (on some sites) and custom taxonomies are just not shown. If every metabox ever made for WordPress needs to be remade, it sure is going to make developers&#8217; lives a living hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matt Cromwell also detailed a nightmare scenario of having more custom blocks than the current UI can handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens when you have 25 plugins that all want to load 25 custom blocks into that tiny &#8216;Insert&#8217; dropdown?&#8221; Cromwell said. &#8220;Will there be a search? Or will it just scroll forever?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullenweg specifically addressed some of these concerns in his Q&amp;A session at WordCamp Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people have a lot of things built into the edit screen, so part of the reason we&#8217;re putting it out there as a plugin first and also pushing it so hard to get as many people to install it as possible, is so that everyone who has posting and editing screen adjustments can rethink them to be beautiful within this new framework,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>
<p>Mullenweg anticipates that WordPress will release version 4.9 before merging Gutenberg, because he wants to see it tested on more than 100,000 sites before replacing the edit screen. If all goes well, the new editor could land in WordPress 5.0.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that some things that people did, like TinyMCE toolbar things, aren&#8217;t really needed any more,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Stuff that people did in the past with custom post types might be better as blocks. It gives us a real opportunity to reimagine a lot of the user interactions and flows that today we&#8217;ve taken for granted on the edit screen for five or six years.&#8221;</p>

<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 22:29:55 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";}s:7:"summary";s:9087:"<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>One of the featured sessions at WordCamp Europe 2017 was Om Malik&#8217;s interview with Matt Mullenweg, followed by a 20-minute Q&amp;A from the audience. After showing a preview of the new Gutenberg editor with dynamic blocks replacing widgets, Mullenweg announced that it is now <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank">available as a plugin on WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>Gutenberg has been in development for six months and is ready for testing, but its developers do not recommend using it on production sites. Anyone interested in the future of WordPress will want to take it for a test drive, as the new editor will revolutionize the way users think about creating and editing content. The demo video at WordCamp Europe also showed Gutenberg working smoothly in a mobile context.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may appear that WordPress is trying to copy its more recent competitors (Medium, Wix, and others) to keep pace, but the 14-year-old software has offered many of these content capabilities for years. Mullenweg explained how the new editor simply unifies the UI into blocks that can be placed anywhere. Gutenberg is set to replace widgets, the HTML UI of shortcodes, and blocks previously offered through the TinyMCE toolbar.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gutenberg-blocks.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken stabs at this before, if you imagine our previous efforts with post formats &#8211; to make it easier to do certain types of media or quote posts or things like that,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That whole concept can now flatten to just being a block. Working all that in, it&#8217;s bringing things we&#8217;ve been thinking about for a very long time in WordPress.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever sat down with a new user to introduce them to WordPress, then you probably answered a long list of painful questions regarding the many varied and confusing ways of creating content. Gutenberg has the potential to make WordPress much easier to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now WordPress makes you learn a lot of concepts &#8211; shortcodes, widgets, the stuff that exists inside TinyMCE as blocks today &#8211; and people rightly wonder why they can&#8217;t use those things everywhere,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is shift it so that you only have to learn about blocks once and once you learn about the image block, that can be in a post, in a sidebar, in a page, in a custom post type, and it will work exactly the same way. Whatever is integrated with it, let&#8217;s say a plugin that brings in your Google Photos or your Dropbox, that will now work everywhere, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullenweg said his previous attempt at replacing TinyMCE lasted approximately two years and they never ended up shipping it. Getting Gutenberg off the ground at this time allows WordPress to take the best of what competitors in both open source and commercial spaces have been doing, and improve upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medium started five or six years ago,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Browser technology, what you can do, has advanced quite a bit. I think this actually allows us to leapfrog past some of the really great visual editors, because we&#8217;re able to build on the shoulders of things like Medium, Wix, Squarespace, and others that have come before us.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Gutenberg First Impressions and Concerns</h3>
<p>The Gutenberg plugin is now active on more than 300 sites and first impressions are rolling in. This is the first time the new block editor has been easily accessible to any user who wants to try it. Gutenberg also offers a somewhat unique testing experience in that it creates its own menu inside WordPress, so users don&#8217;t have to choose between the old editor and the new one. Activating Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t make it an either/or experience and users can test at their own convenience.</p>
<p>From my initial testing, I found that Gutenberg provides a clean and enjoyable experience. Up until this point many of us couldn&#8217;t fully anticipate what Gutenberg would look like, but the interface is very similar to what one might imagine for an improved &#8220;distraction-free writing experience.&#8221; Gutenberg provides a more minimal UI for both the visual and text editors, although inserting blocks seems to be less functional when using the text editor.</p>

<hr />
<p>There’s been some <a href="http://chrislema.com/wordpress-economy-shrinking/">recent speculation</a> on whether or not the WordPress economy is beginning to slump. I would answer &#8216;yes&#8217; and &#8216;no&#8217;; it <em>is</em> clearly evolving, and some areas are contracting while others are growing. I believe we are feeling the effects of<strong> </strong><b>market maturity</b>.</p>
<p>Are downmarket “one stop shop” alternatives and in house teams the best solution for the future of WordPress? No, because hosting providers, developers, and agencies who specialize in this space are where the concentrated real quality resides, and people are always willing to pay for quality. Ultimately WordPress has staying power because of its ecosystem, so let’s take stock of that.</p>
<h2>The current state of the WordPress economy</h2>
<p>In 2017 WordPress is used by major publishers, enterprise, <a href="https://pagely.com/solutions/universities/">universities</a> and even custom SaaS applications. In fact the world’s leaders in business and marketing trends use WordPress (and aren’t necessarily leveraging in house teams to do so). To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/">Facebook Newsroom</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gv.com/">Google Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/">Mercedes Benz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/">Bloomberg Professional</a></li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress powers an estimated <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/features/">28% of all websites</a> which run the gamut of single contributor blogs and simple websites to applications and complex portals. That’s nearly 75 million websites built by anyone from a very beginner to an extremely advanced level of technical skill. It’s both easy to use and graceful in its complex abilities to do just about anything you would need a website to do.</p>
<p>There’s also the community behind WordPress, an ecosystem in and of itself of people around the world with this one thing in common. As an <a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/05/citizen-guide-open-source-community/">open source community</a>, our entire industry is plugged into every update. We can contribute to testing or code. We have all the power to make sure the WordPress economy stays strong and continues to grow.</p>
<p>New businesses are constantly being formed around plugins, themes and services built specifically for WordPress, with no signs of stopping. In fact, we’ll continue to find more and more creators of WordPress specific companies, with full time jobs elsewhere, using this as an opportunity to contribute to the community.</p>
<p class="lead txt-danger">However, the near constant flow of new entries into an already saturated market is outstripping demand. The WordPress pie overall is still growing but not quick enough to absorb the new sellers entering into the lower third of the market. The new players are typically unable to challenge the dominant players for a significant market share, and the demands and needs of the customers are also moving up the value chain. Yes, some newcomers do disrupt the established WP players, but it is happening with less frequency and the barrier is ever higher.</p>
<h2>Economies ebb &amp; flow: Apple and Airbnb (and WordPress)</h2>
<p>The companies and brands that have changed the way people live experience low points. Just like the ones we’ve feared will appear in our own industry. But you know these companies well and they, and their economies, have persevered.</p>
<p>Take the classic example, one of the greatest comeback stories of all time: Apple. Apple defied all odds and went from near bankruptcy to the powerhouse hardware leader it is today with over a billion iPhones currently in use. They lost Steve Jobs and many feared they would lose their focus and tumble downward. Instead they’re the <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/05/five-years-after-steve-jobs-an-apple-with-the-courage-to-say-no">largest and most profitable</a> they’ve ever been. Walk down the streets of New York City or San Francisco and you’ll see brick and mortar shops dedicated to alt-genius-bar services and shattered screen replacement. The Apple economy is strong.</p>
<p>Just like Apple, Airbnb almost flopped, but came out on top. It has an ecosystem of its own with tons of offshoot companies that support various aspects of the community, just like WordPress. After near failure Airbnb now supports a community of over 100 million and is valued at over $30 billion. They also face <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-11/airbnb-faces-growing-pains-as-it-passes-100-million-users">growing pains</a> and &#8212; at times &#8212; volatility, but companies like this that fundamentally change the way the world works aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>WordPress itself isn’t in danger of a near flop, but these are valuable examples of economies that fared far worse, and still made it through.</p>
<h2>The core strengths of WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress possesses fundamental characteristics that so many of today’s great leaders encompass. All leaders like this are built to support a growing economy for a long time to come.</p>
<h3>Brand</h3>
<p>In Pagely&#8217;s own recent user survey, the most important factors for choosing a service were <strong>reliability </strong>and <strong>security</strong>. These are cornerstones of the WordPress brand <em>(haters gonna hate – but core has been really solid for many years in both respects)</em> and reasons why such a large percentage of the internet continues to choose it to power their websites. As a brand, WordPress is synonymous with being one of the most reliable and secure CMS options available. Quality service providers that support WordPress, like Pagely, also often encompass these brand characteristics. We often hear of these same characteristics as pain points from customers trying to work in-house or with downmarket alternatives.</p>
<h3>Ubiquity</h3>
<p>WordPress users span nearly every industry in the world. Publishers, Fortune 500 Companies, Music, Fashion, Tech, Politics, you name it. Like I mentioned above, ~75 million websites exist with WordPress and they are published in dozens of languages/locales. WordPress is literally a web that has woven itself through the digital and physical world.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>The WordPress community is made up of contributors, coders, engineers, designers, marketing professionals, and every other title necessary to run a business. The community reaches so far that it touches every corner of today’s tech workforce. Not only is the community large, but it cares. We care. The number of blogs and forums dedicated to helping people understand WordPress are impossible to count. Events like WordCamp, LoopConf, Publish, and PressNomics occur all year long and prominent core contributors participate. Don’t hate me for loosely quoting Lincoln. But, it could be said here that “[WordPress] of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”</p>
<h2>The WordPress ecosystem rewards quality</h2>
<p>While the core strengths of WordPress support the service itself, quality is what supports the economy as a whole. And the fact remains that people <em>are</em> willing to pay for quality. To paint the picture, at Pagely a core aspect of our mission is to bring a flexible, friendly, and first-rate experience to all our customers. In staying true to that high standard of quality we’ve seen substantial <a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/01/pagely-2016-in-review/">year over year revenue growth since 2014</a>. With an ecosystem that strives for and rewards quality, the larger WordPress economy is in a position to keep growing – continuing to take us along with it.</p>
<p>Any ‘economy’ will ebb and flow but when a technology powers 28% of something, it has staying power; WordPress and the ecosystem we’ve built around it isn’t going anywhere, <strong>but it is changing</strong>.</p>
<h2>The ecosystem is maturing — and growing</h2>
<p>I would argue that after 12+ years the WordPress ecosystem has firmly moved from “<strong>New market</strong>” territory where there were wide open spaces for entrants to dominate. As an example, commercial themes really took off in 2008,  managed WordPress hosting came to prominence in 2010, and commercial plugins rose to fame in 2011. These, and most channels in the ecosystem are now clearly defined “<strong>Existing markets”</strong>.</p>
<p>Since 2015 or so, the majors players in each category are known, with few exceptions of new entrants claiming significant market share. <strong>Those that are doing so are using <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/the-four-types-of-market-market-maturity-where-does-your-startups-product-belong/">strategies</a> common in existing markets: Resegmentation based on price, and resegmentation based on a niche strategy.</strong></p>
<p>Borrowed from <a href="https://www.inc.com/karl-and-bill/6-signs-your-market-is-maturing.html">this article</a>, we can identify six signs a market is maturing. Not every point applies completely to our ecosystem, but enough do I believe we can safely make this call.</p>
<ol>
<li class="mb-1">Customer needs/desires do not appear to be evolving rapidly.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">eCommerce and membership sites are the most recent ‘asks’ that come to mind, and that was a few years ago.</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Consolidation by leading competitors is reducing competitive intensity.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">GoDaddy, EIG, Envato, and Automattic are rapidly consolidating products and services into their domain</small>.</li>
<li class="mb-1">Disruptive innovations and new entrants are gaining share only gradually and top out at relatively low levels.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">Some really innovative things are happening, but around the corners and seem slow to pick up traction.</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Market shares of leading competitors have solidified and are changing gradually, if at all.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">We pretty much know who the leaders are in every category and at what price points they own.</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Price, brand and/or channel strategy has supplanted product innovation as key value drivers.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">Refining the value proposition to our customers has greater focus at Pagely vs. shipping the latest tech du jour (which is happening just behind the scenes at measured pace).</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Cash flows are increasingly turning positive and being returned to investors rather than invested into the market.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">Not in all cases, there is still much energy being focused into market expansion.</small></li>
</ol>
<span class="pullquote alignright">The pie is still growing overall, but a higher % of that growth is being concentrated among the established leaders that do more than the basics.</span>
<p>The massive low-cost hosting providers are enrolling many thousands of new WordPress users a day. Their product offering is good enough for the price point, their marketing spends are huge, and any new customer starting to use WordPress is landing there.</p>
<p>It is the same with eCommerce on WordPress — there are just two or three plugins and services absorbing new users.</p>
<p>In the agency space, the buyers willing to spend capital (enough to sustain a high-end WordPress agency) on WordPress solutions are not buying $500 websites, or $5,000 websites as they once were. They are buying $50K-$1M custom-built WordPress backed applications. The resources and talent required to serve these clients is concentrated at a handful of established and well known shops.</p>
<p>These examples continue into every segment of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>WordPress is getting easier and easier to use right out of the box. And if the majority of the new WordPress users needs are solved on install (via core, bundled plugins, or the hosting platform) then a wide swath of the current ecosystem is going to shrink.</p>
<p><strong>In all channels, new market entrants or existing small shops are being out-gunned by the established players, or the buyers needs are being met upon install.</strong></p>
<h2>Adapt to win</h2>
<p>So is the WordPress ecosystem shrinking? <strong>Yes, segments of it are and will continue to do so</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s like in any industry: the car replaced the horse and the robot replaced the factory worker. What was successful in the New Market phase may not work in the more mature, Existing Market phase we are in.</p>
<p><strong> Other segments, many not even identified yet, will expand.</strong> There are still big challenges that need to be solved in WordPress, the solutions for which will surely prove to be innovative and profitable. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491">Go find the next blue ocean</a>.</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 22:00:09 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:14:"Joshua Strebel";}s:7:"summary";s:13890:"<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: This is a guest post by Joshua Strebel, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://pagely.com">Pagely</a>.

<p>In 2017 WordPress is used by major publishers, enterprise, <a href="https://pagely.com/solutions/universities/">universities</a> and even custom SaaS applications. In fact the world’s leaders in business and marketing trends use WordPress (and aren’t necessarily leveraging in house teams to do so). To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/">Facebook Newsroom</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gv.com/">Google Ventures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/">Mercedes Benz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/">Bloomberg Professional</a></li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress powers an estimated <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/features/">28% of all websites</a> which run the gamut of single contributor blogs and simple websites to applications and complex portals. That’s nearly 75 million websites built by anyone from a very beginner to an extremely advanced level of technical skill. It’s both easy to use and graceful in its complex abilities to do just about anything you would need a website to do.</p>
<p>There’s also the community behind WordPress, an ecosystem in and of itself of people around the world with this one thing in common. As an <a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/05/citizen-guide-open-source-community/">open source community</a>, our entire industry is plugged into every update. We can contribute to testing or code. We have all the power to make sure the WordPress economy stays strong and continues to grow.</p>
<p>New businesses are constantly being formed around plugins, themes and services built specifically for WordPress, with no signs of stopping. In fact, we’ll continue to find more and more creators of WordPress specific companies, with full time jobs elsewhere, using this as an opportunity to contribute to the community.</p>
<p class="lead txt-danger">However, the near constant flow of new entries into an already saturated market is outstripping demand. The WordPress pie overall is still growing but not quick enough to absorb the new sellers entering into the lower third of the market. The new players are typically unable to challenge the dominant players for a significant market share, and the demands and needs of the customers are also moving up the value chain. Yes, some newcomers do disrupt the established WP players, but it is happening with less frequency and the barrier is ever higher.</p>
<h2>Economies ebb &amp; flow: Apple and Airbnb (and WordPress)</h2>
<p>The companies and brands that have changed the way people live experience low points. Just like the ones we’ve feared will appear in our own industry. But you know these companies well and they, and their economies, have persevered.</p>
<p>Take the classic example, one of the greatest comeback stories of all time: Apple. Apple defied all odds and went from near bankruptcy to the powerhouse hardware leader it is today with over a billion iPhones currently in use. They lost Steve Jobs and many feared they would lose their focus and tumble downward. Instead they’re the <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/05/five-years-after-steve-jobs-an-apple-with-the-courage-to-say-no">largest and most profitable</a> they’ve ever been. Walk down the streets of New York City or San Francisco and you’ll see brick and mortar shops dedicated to alt-genius-bar services and shattered screen replacement. The Apple economy is strong.</p>
<p>Just like Apple, Airbnb almost flopped, but came out on top. It has an ecosystem of its own with tons of offshoot companies that support various aspects of the community, just like WordPress. After near failure Airbnb now supports a community of over 100 million and is valued at over $30 billion. They also face <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-11/airbnb-faces-growing-pains-as-it-passes-100-million-users">growing pains</a> and &#8212; at times &#8212; volatility, but companies like this that fundamentally change the way the world works aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>WordPress itself isn’t in danger of a near flop, but these are valuable examples of economies that fared far worse, and still made it through.</p>
<h2>The core strengths of WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress possesses fundamental characteristics that so many of today’s great leaders encompass. All leaders like this are built to support a growing economy for a long time to come.</p>
<h3>Brand</h3>
<p>In Pagely&#8217;s own recent user survey, the most important factors for choosing a service were <strong>reliability </strong>and <strong>security</strong>. These are cornerstones of the WordPress brand <em>(haters gonna hate – but core has been really solid for many years in both respects)</em> and reasons why such a large percentage of the internet continues to choose it to power their websites. As a brand, WordPress is synonymous with being one of the most reliable and secure CMS options available. Quality service providers that support WordPress, like Pagely, also often encompass these brand characteristics. We often hear of these same characteristics as pain points from customers trying to work in-house or with downmarket alternatives.</p>
<h3>Ubiquity</h3>
<p>WordPress users span nearly every industry in the world. Publishers, Fortune 500 Companies, Music, Fashion, Tech, Politics, you name it. Like I mentioned above, ~75 million websites exist with WordPress and they are published in dozens of languages/locales. WordPress is literally a web that has woven itself through the digital and physical world.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>The WordPress community is made up of contributors, coders, engineers, designers, marketing professionals, and every other title necessary to run a business. The community reaches so far that it touches every corner of today’s tech workforce. Not only is the community large, but it cares. We care. The number of blogs and forums dedicated to helping people understand WordPress are impossible to count. Events like WordCamp, LoopConf, Publish, and PressNomics occur all year long and prominent core contributors participate. Don’t hate me for loosely quoting Lincoln. But, it could be said here that “[WordPress] of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.”</p>
<h2>The WordPress ecosystem rewards quality</h2>
<p>While the core strengths of WordPress support the service itself, quality is what supports the economy as a whole. And the fact remains that people <em>are</em> willing to pay for quality. To paint the picture, at Pagely a core aspect of our mission is to bring a flexible, friendly, and first-rate experience to all our customers. In staying true to that high standard of quality we’ve seen substantial <a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/01/pagely-2016-in-review/">year over year revenue growth since 2014</a>. With an ecosystem that strives for and rewards quality, the larger WordPress economy is in a position to keep growing – continuing to take us along with it.</p>
<p>Any ‘economy’ will ebb and flow but when a technology powers 28% of something, it has staying power; WordPress and the ecosystem we’ve built around it isn’t going anywhere, <strong>but it is changing</strong>.</p>
<h2>The ecosystem is maturing — and growing</h2>
<p>I would argue that after 12+ years the WordPress ecosystem has firmly moved from “<strong>New market</strong>” territory where there were wide open spaces for entrants to dominate. As an example, commercial themes really took off in 2008,  managed WordPress hosting came to prominence in 2010, and commercial plugins rose to fame in 2011. These, and most channels in the ecosystem are now clearly defined “<strong>Existing markets”</strong>.</p>
<p>Since 2015 or so, the majors players in each category are known, with few exceptions of new entrants claiming significant market share. <strong>Those that are doing so are using <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/the-four-types-of-market-market-maturity-where-does-your-startups-product-belong/">strategies</a> common in existing markets: Resegmentation based on price, and resegmentation based on a niche strategy.</strong></p>
<p>Borrowed from <a href="https://www.inc.com/karl-and-bill/6-signs-your-market-is-maturing.html">this article</a>, we can identify six signs a market is maturing. Not every point applies completely to our ecosystem, but enough do I believe we can safely make this call.</p>
<ol>
<li class="mb-1">Customer needs/desires do not appear to be evolving rapidly.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">eCommerce and membership sites are the most recent ‘asks’ that come to mind, and that was a few years ago.</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Consolidation by leading competitors is reducing competitive intensity.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">GoDaddy, EIG, Envato, and Automattic are rapidly consolidating products and services into their domain</small>.</li>
<li class="mb-1">Disruptive innovations and new entrants are gaining share only gradually and top out at relatively low levels.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">Some really innovative things are happening, but around the corners and seem slow to pick up traction.</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Market shares of leading competitors have solidified and are changing gradually, if at all.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">We pretty much know who the leaders are in every category and at what price points they own.</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Price, brand and/or channel strategy has supplanted product innovation as key value drivers.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">Refining the value proposition to our customers has greater focus at Pagely vs. shipping the latest tech du jour (which is happening just behind the scenes at measured pace).</small></li>
<li class="mb-1">Cash flows are increasingly turning positive and being returned to investors rather than invested into the market.<br />
– <small class="txt-danger">Not in all cases, there is still much energy being focused into market expansion.</small></li>
</ol>
<span class="pullquote alignright">The pie is still growing overall, but a higher % of that growth is being concentrated among the established leaders that do more than the basics.</span>
<p>The massive low-cost hosting providers are enrolling many thousands of new WordPress users a day. Their product offering is good enough for the price point, their marketing spends are huge, and any new customer starting to use WordPress is landing there.</p>
<p>It is the same with eCommerce on WordPress — there are just two or three plugins and services absorbing new users.</p>
<p>In the agency space, the buyers willing to spend capital (enough to sustain a high-end WordPress agency) on WordPress solutions are not buying $500 websites, or $5,000 websites as they once were. They are buying $50K-$1M custom-built WordPress backed applications. The resources and talent required to serve these clients is concentrated at a handful of established and well known shops.</p>
<p>These examples continue into every segment of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>WordPress is getting easier and easier to use right out of the box. And if the majority of the new WordPress users needs are solved on install (via core, bundled plugins, or the hosting platform) then a wide swath of the current ecosystem is going to shrink.</p>
<p><strong>In all channels, new market entrants or existing small shops are being out-gunned by the established players, or the buyers needs are being met upon install.</strong></p>
<h2>Adapt to win</h2>
<p>So is the WordPress ecosystem shrinking? <strong>Yes, segments of it are and will continue to do so</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s like in any industry: the car replaced the horse and the robot replaced the factory worker. What was successful in the New Market phase may not work in the more mature, Existing Market phase we are in.</p>
<p><strong> Other segments, many not even identified yet, will expand.</strong> There are still big challenges that need to be solved in WordPress, the solutions for which will surely prove to be innovative and profitable. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491">Go find the next blue ocean</a>.</p>";}i:5;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:112:"WPTavern: WordPress Marketing Team Launches Case Studies and Usage Survey for Agencies, Clients, and Enterprises";s:4:"guid";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=71973";s:4:"link";s:121:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-marketing-team-launches-case-studies-and-usage-survey-for-agencies-clients-and-enterprises";s:11:"description";s:5563:"<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/survey.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/FI3UYVGNFD">Lukasz Kowalewski</a>
<p>WordPress&#8217; Marketing Team has <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/" target="_blank">launched a set of surveys</a> to gather case studies and usage data from agencies, clients, and enterprises, with the goal of providing more resources for adoption. The Usage Survey was created to capture feedback on the factors that influenced an organization to select WordPress as well as any barriers to using the software. The team plans to use use the data to provide resources, such as fact sheets, FAQs, case studies, testimonial videos, and other marketing materials.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2016-mullenweg-pushes-calypso-as-future-of-wordpress-interface-proposes-major-changes-to-release-cycle" target="_blank">State of the Word address in 2016</a>, Matt Mullenweg said the project could no longer get by on &#8220;marketing happenstance&#8221; but needed to form a more coordinated effort to counter the millions of dollars that proprietary systems are spending marketing their products against WordPress. These research surveys are one of the first steps in that direction, along with the <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-proposes-wordpress-growth-council" target="_blank">WordPress Growth Council</a> that Mullenweg formed to bring together more people with large-scale marketing expertise.</p>
<p>With the proliferation of user-friendly, DIY commercial website solutions, WordPress has reached a critical time where the project needs to shed its image as a clunky, legacy CMS and demonstrate why it&#8217;s the market leader. This not only requires WordPress to deliver from a technical standpoint, especially in the areas of editing and customization, but also requires the 14-year-old project to step up its marketing efforts.</p>
<p>WordPress&#8217; Marketing Team exists to &#8220;help people market WordPress as open source software and the WordPress community.&#8221; The need is evident, as even the most experienced WordPress professionals struggle to properly articulate the difference between WordPress.com and the self-hosted software in a way that newcomers can understand. This is an intractable marketing problem for the self-hosted community.</p>

<p>We discuss contributor day and the effects of having it at the beginning of a WordCamp instead of at the end. Each individual shared their experience attending the event and described what their favorite session was.</p>
<p>Lunch was provided at WordCamp Europe in paper bags with plastic utensils. With 1,900 attendees, this resulted in a lot of trash. We discussed the impact WordCamps can have on the environment and why larger WordPress events should act as a role model for being as sustainable as possible.</p>
<p>We also talked about <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">WordPress marketing team&#8217;s efforts</a>, and the differences between WordCamp US and EU.</p>

That's powerful." /><h3>So you make websites, right?</h3>
<p>My name’s Juan and I make websites. I’ve been doing that since my brother came home with a computer’s magazine that had a CD with a copy of Front Page 98. I learned about HTML. Tables. Marquees. Divs. CSS. Flash. ActionScript. JavaScript. PHP-Nuke. phpBB. Blogger. And, finally, in 2008, I learned about WordPress.</p>
<p>I loved writing and enjoyed having my own blog after seeing that social networks like MySpace or Fotolog weren’t going too far. I kept learning and found the power of WordPress to create more complex sites. I decided that my hobby could be my job. I became a freelancer. I found clients, I made lots of mistakes, I didn’t make much money. I was alone in my small village in the North of Spain: Santoña, in Cantabria.</p>
<p>I knew I wasn’t the only one creating websites around, but I never thought about meeting people like me. I didn’t know about the real power of Open Source. I was isolated, planning to move with my girlfriend to another city, Pontevedra, and I didn’t have a clue about what was going to happen soon in my life.</p>
<h3>The power of WordCamps</h3>
<p>One day I found out that in November of 2015 there was going to be a WordCamp in Santander, a city 50 km. far from my village. An event for WordPress developers and users. That sounded good. I had no idea that that kind of events were happening all around the world. I had no idea about anything related to the WordPress Community. I didn’t know that the Community was even a thing.</p>
<p>So I went there a Saturday morning and attended to most of the talks.</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember sitting in the last rows, as if I were hiding so no one would notice that I was there alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t want to say anything stupid and I was just absorbing all I could from the speakers and their presentations.</p>
<p>After a great talk about theme development I waited for the speaker and I thanked him for all the info. I was nervous. He was a speaker. He was from another league, right? But he was a really nice guy, ‘if you have any doubt, just ask me’. Cool.</p>
<p>On Sunday we had the Contributor’s Day. And there I was, randomly in the Community table, learning how to organize a Meetup with some people I had just met, Rocío Valdivia and Ibon Azkoitia. Remember these names. They told me that, as I was moving to another city where there wasn’t any WordPress group, I could start one myself.</p>
<p>My brain: Wait a second. Me? Starting a WordPress Meetup in Pontevedra?</p>
<p>I took notes and kept enjoying the day. I met many people and, being not very good remembering names, all I could do was following them on Twitter. And signing in the WP Slack channel.</p>
<p>At the end of the event, Darío, the main organizer asked me about how was the experience. I had loved it. Will you come back? Yeah, but next year… as a speaker!</p>
<p>My brain, again: As a speaker? Are you really listening to yourself? You hate speaking in public. You’re the most nervous person ever.</p>
<h3>My first year in the Spanish WordPress Community</h3>
<p>The days after the event were weird. I started reading about the people I met and I found out that some of them were incredible developers, some of them had thousands of followers in Twitter, some of them had the most important websites about WordPress in our language… And I didn’t have a clue about all that.</p>
<p>Did it matter? Not at all. These people don’t care about those things and will help you no matter who you are or where you are coming from.</p>
<p>Moving to a new place was a slow process, so I didn’t have to worry about the Meetup I promised to organize, but the weeks were running and I had no idea about what to talk about in the next WordCamp as I told Darío.</p>
<p>I started to become a little more involved in the Community. I helped translating plugins to Spanish. The original translation of WooCommerce was made by a drunk robot or similar, so there were thousands of strings to be revised and translated again. It was fun. And a lot of work that I did with the help of Fernando Tellado, an experienced translator and member of the Community.</p>
<blockquote><p>And I was helping hundreds of people that were using WordPress for their businesses. That’s powerful. I was helping many people.</p></blockquote>
<p>By that time I was reading many WordPress related blogs and sites and I decided to curate a weekly post with the ten best links (in Spanish and English) I read every week. That’s how I started Enlace Permanente, which is almost now in its #70 edition with many subscribers to the newsletter and followers.</p>
<p>I kept talking with Ibon, Darío and others in the Slack channels and on September of 2016 we decided to go to WordCamp Seville. I travelled the country from North to South and spent there a fantastic weekend. I shared an AirBnb apartment with Ibon, Mauricio Gelves and Fernan Díez, who became great friends. I met more new people and strengthened the relationship with ‘older’ mates.</p>
<p>And, as I was finally moving to a new flat in Pontevedra, I decided it was time to start the local Community of the city. A city where I didn’t know any other developer or WordPress user. But… I was sure someone will be there.</p>
<p>I had the help of Rocío, who works at Automattic and all her time is donated to the WordPress.org Community team, working at WordCamp Central helping Meetup and WordCamp organizers all around the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>She was extremely helpful and she’s the reason that today in Spain we have more than 40 different Meetups and 5 WordCamps in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>I planned the first event for the end of November, but before, I had to send an email to Darío as the Call for Speakers of WordCamp Santander 2016 was already open. I decided to talk about my experience the last year. ‘From being no one to being a speaker: a year in the Spanish WordPress Community’. That was the title of my talk.</p>
<p>And yes, I was nervous. I didn’t sleep well the week before. I talked quickly. But I did it. People laughed, people clapped and people enjoyed my story. This story. And they learned about how they could help an awesome Open Source project like WordPress and meet great people at the same time.</p>
<h3>Becoming a known member of the Community</h3>
<p>When you become part of a Community for the first time, you easily find that there are small groups within the big one. People that already know each other of past events, of past projects. And maybe you think that it’s not easy to be part of those groups. Or that they won’t accept a new one.</p>
<p>Well, that didn’t happen to me in the WordPress Community.</p>
<p>Everyone was ready to say ‘hi’ to the latest addition. Everyone was ready to help with translation doubts. Everyone was ready to share their experience organizing local groups. Or answering questions in the support forums. Or just ready to chit chat. Or to organize a trip for the next WordCamp.</p>
<p>So I just started doing the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>And you don’t do it to become a known member of the Community. That’s just a catchy phrase for the post. You do it because it feels good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because you meet great developers, designers, freelancers… Because you can help anyone who knows a little less than you, the same way that the people that know more help you.</p>
<p>In 2017 I was lucky enough to be part of WordCamp Madrid and WordCamp Bilbao, as a volunteer and as a speaker. I had the chance to talk about something that I’m really passionate in Madrid: the open web. I had the chance to speak up about net neutrality, about our contents, about walled gardens, about what we can do to save the web. I shared an important message with my peers.</p>
<p>And in Bilbao I had the chance to explain the process of creating a WordPress theme from the moment the designer starts wireframing a project. My day to day job. Best practices, advice, tools, how-tos… I showed how I do my job to become better at it and to help others to become better too.</p>
<p>Also in Pontevedra, we’re around 20-25 people every month in the local Meetup. And in Galicia, the region where I live, I’ve helped creating two more Meetup groups, in Ourense &amp; Lugo. And I’m sure there will be more soon! There are almost 3 million people here, so many WordPress users still to find!</p>
<h3>And what now?</h3>
<p>I want to keep having fun and working to make WordPress a better tool and platform for as many people as possible. I want to find more people in the local communities to show them what we have here. And who knows? Maybe organizing a WordCamp in 2018.</p>
<p>Also, in the next months I would like to find out if it’s possible also to become a more active member of the Global WordPress Community. As English is not our first language and we’re a little shy, probably not many Spanish speakers are known in the WP world. But I’m sure that the steps I did to become part of our national group can be done exactly the same way to be part of the international one, don’t you think?</p>
<p>So, who knows? Will I go to a WordCamp in the USA or another country next year… as a speaker?</p>
<p>And you? Are you ready to become part of your local and national Community? It’s easier than you think, I’m sure of that. Just… say it out loud and start doing stuff.</p>

<p>The Serbian WordPress community has <a href="https://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">grown exponentially since the first WordPress meetup</a> was held in 2013 at ManageWP&#8217;s offices. Now, Serbia hosts meetups in several cities and many of them are averaging more than 100 attendees. Meetup.com is not very popular in Serbia so the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/613503768679500/" target="_blank">WP Serbia Facebook group</a> is used more frequently to organize community events. The group has grown from 600 members to more than 4,700 during over the past two and a half years.</p>
<p>At WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to interview Jenny Beaumont, this year&#8217;s local lead for Paris, along with Milan Ivanović who will lead the local team next year in Serbia. Beaumont shares the challenges of wrangling busy volunteers on the local team and offers Ivanović some advice as he prepares to head up the team in Serbia.

<p>The Serbian WordPress community has <a href="https://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">grown exponentially since the first WordPress meetup</a> was held in 2013 at ManageWP&#8217;s offices. Now, Serbia hosts meetups in several cities and many of them are averaging more than 100 attendees. Meetup.com is not very popular in Serbia so the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/613503768679500/" target="_blank">WP Serbia Facebook group</a> is used more frequently to organize community events. The group has grown from 600 members to more than 4,700 during over the past two and a half years.</p>
<p>At WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to interview Jenny Beaumont, this year&#8217;s local lead for Paris, along with Milan Ivanović who will lead the local team next year in Serbia. Beaumont shares the challenges of wrangling busy volunteers on the local team and offers Ivanović some advice as he prepares to head up the team in Serbia. Ivanović is eager to acquaint WordPress&#8217; global community with Serbia&#8217;s famous hospitality and sums up why prospective attendees should consider attending in 2018: &#8220;The food!&#8221;</p>

<p>A customer upset by the change contacted WooCommerce&#8217;s support desk and inquired about the price increase. The support representative confirmed that the discount was removed and that customers will need to pay full-price to renew.</p>

<p>&#8220;However this type of approach to business is very sad. I have no problem paying for a license despite the fact that GPL software is available cheaper and legally/ethically by other means.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will still stick to WooCommerce since the core is fantastic and is getting better. The biggest change for me will be the plugins and code I use to extend WooCommerce functionality. I will probably start to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest gripe I have is with the way WooCommerce does business. WooCommerce has never seemed to care about their customers. Slipping this pricing change in was not an honest move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raising prices for renewals is a part of business and something I think many customers expect at some point. However, raising prices on subscriptions that existing customers may have set to auto-renew, without explicitly notifying them about the change, can create a negative, lasting experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe</a> was held this weekend in Paris, bringing together 1,900 attendees from 79 countries. Another 1,000 people joined via livestream from 77 countries to make a total audience of 2,900 participants from 92 countries. The number of attendees on the ground was about one third less than original estimates of 3,000, but everyone who wanted a ticket was able to get one. A team of 221 volunteers communicated on Slack behind the scenes to make the event run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>The event&#8217;s 45 organizers made the presentations more accessible to speakers of different languages with live captioning and real-time audio translation.</p>

<p>WordCamp Europe is the leading WordPress event for catching presentations about the ongoing efforts to bring the software to all the languages of the world. A large percentage of attendees were multi-lingual leaders in WordPress&#8217; translation community, resulting in many presentations and lightning talks focused on topics like communication, internationalization, organizing translation sprints, and using inclusive language for interfaces.</p>

<p>Matt Mullenweg and Om Malik joined the event for a casual Q&amp;A session with attendees wherein Mullenweg showed a demo of the new Gutenberg editor and announced its availability as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank">a plugin on WordPress.org</a>. We&#8217;ll cover their comments on the future of the editor and the open web more in-depth in another post.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe sponsors had space for large 360° booths and the opportunity to be featured in 30-second advertisements between sessions. Organizers also arranged for sponsor workshops with a dedicated space for those who purchased the highest sponsorship levels. These workshops included topics like Creating a WordPress Theme for the Masses, Intro to WooCommerce, Jetpack tips, and hosting product demos.</p>

<p>WordCamp Europe had no shortage of swag unique to the event, including a limited edition French plush Wapuu, posters, postcards, socks, stickers for European WordCamps, and other items for sale in the traveling Swag Store. A giant, stuffed French Wapuu made the rounds, appearing in pictures with attendees.</p>

<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-kicks-off-with-contributor-day-focused-on-growing-wordpress-through-inclusion" target="_blank">Contributor Day</a> kicked off the event on Thursday with a strong turnout of 473 attendees. Traditionally, WordCamp contributor days are held on Sunday after the main event, the day following the after party when many who signed up struggle to make it on time &#8211; or at all. WordCamp Europe attendees generally appreciated having the contributor day scheduled before the main conference and the higher attendance numbers demonstrate the success of this arrangement.</p>
<p>The after party featured a 1930&#8217;s theme at the Pavillon d’Armenonville. Attendees dressed the part and enjoyed a relaxing end to the WordCamp with an evening of dancing and meeting new and old friends.</p>
